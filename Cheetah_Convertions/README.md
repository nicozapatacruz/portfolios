# Cheetah Conversions Projects

This are the projects I participated in during my internship of the Bachelors Degree in Cheetah Convertions in 2021 in Berlin, Germany.

The main project was to redesign the HomePage of the company, design that you can find in the files Cheetah_Convertiones_Web.pdf and Cheetah_Other_Pages.pdf.

The other files, are some posts that I made for the company so they could use them in their social media, promoting their services in that moment.
